# Midas Touch

Every block you touch (walk on) turns to whatever block you configure! You can also set a blacklist of blocks that won't be affected.

**ChatGPT:** Midas Touch is a Minecraft plugin that lets players transform every block they step on into a different block selected by the server admin via a config file. It's a fun and unique addition to any server, offering players a new way to interact with their Minecraft world. With its customizable features, players can enjoy a personalized gameplay experience that is both entertaining and engaging.
